## Study Region {#studyreg}

To be able to investigate the patterns of global historical irrigation expansion, the initial proposed study area encompassed the entirely of the globe's terrestrial land mass with recorded observations detailing every year for the 45-year study period. This constituted a data set of roughly three million observations. In an effort to decrease computation time, a logical reduction of the study area (and therefore data) was necessary.

Figure \@ref(fig:irrfrac-2005) illustrates the pattern of irrigation at the last time step (2005) of the study period. It is notable that irrigation does not exist at all in some places such as the higher latitudes and the Sahara. These areas also contain no cropland, no managed grasslands, and no pastureland. Upon the logic that irrigation cannot expand into areas that contain no agricultural land (whether it be cropland, grassland, or pasture land), all cells which contained no agricultural land over the the course of the study period were removed, giving rise to the study area you see in figure \@ref(fig:study-region-nocrop).

```{r study-region-nocrop, fig.cap="Final study area after the removal of cells with no agricultural land over the course of the 45 year study period. Colors represent regional groupings.

## Data {#data}

To appropriately choose data that encapsulates the concepts and relationships described in Section \@ref(drivers) the following datasets and variables were collected and selected. It should be noted that many of these datasets contain more than one variable that would conceptually represent the links between expanding irrigation and various drivers. The predictors presented below were selected in an iterative model building process for various reasons including data availability (both spatially and temporally), modeling constraints, and conceptual fidelity. For more information on all potential variables please see Appendix Section \@ref(predselect).

The primary variable of interest in this masters thesis, irrigation fraction, along with several other predictor variable were used as input for or were extracted from the Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land (LPJmL) model. Other datasets for various predictors were gathered from datasets external to those used in LPJmL. Detailed descriptions of the acquisition of all data sets are in the sections to follow.

### External Data

#### Topography: Ruggedness {#rugged}

<!--# Come back and fix this part!! -->

In order to explain the relationship between topography and irrigation expansion, an index of a country's topographical heterogeniety was chosen. Other similar irrigation expansion studies similarly use slope (calculated from Digital Elevation Models (DEMs)) as a predictor for explaining irrigation expansion but do so using a 5 arcmin gridded slope dataset [@neumannExploringGlobalIrrigation2011]. Unfortunately for this thesis, grid cells used for analysis are significantly larger[^1], and an aggregation of slope to a larger grid cell was unfeasible for this thesis. Instead, a well know index of country topographical heterogeneity was chosen to represent the "ruggedness" of a country.

[^1]: A 5 arcmin global grid results in a 9.2km by 9.2km grid at the equator. This thesis uses a 0.5° x 0.5° lattitude longitude grid which produces a grid cell of about 55km by 55km at the equator.

##### Terrain Ruggedness Index {#TRI}

The Terrain Ruggedness Index (TRI) was developed by @rileyTerrainRuggednessIndex1999 initially to be used to analyze the effects of topography on species habitats and behaviors. The authors developed a simple method to calculate the heterogeneity of a given area using DEMs. To do so, the sum change in elevation is calculated between a cell and the elevation of its eight nearest neighbors. These individual cell level TRIs can then be averaged for a given region, in this thesis's case, a country [@rileyTerrainRuggednessIndex1999]. Adapted from @rileyTerrainRuggednessIndex1999, a representation of different topography types and the respective TRI scores is displayed in \@ref(fig:tricalc). The exact dataset used for country level TRI is from @nunnRuggednessBlessingBad2012.

```{r tricalc, fig.scap= "Example calculations of Terrain Ruggedness Index (TRI) for differing geographies.", fig.cap= "TRI values a) peak geography, b) bowl geography, c) rolling hill geography. Values presented in the tables represent elevations. Notice that for both a) and b) the TRI is the same despite very different geography, but both values are much higher than c) which is a more homogenous landscape.", out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/TRI_calc.png")
```

##### Description {#ruggeddesc}

In Figure \@ref(fig:TRI) the Terrain Ruggedness Index for the study region can be see. Higher values indicate countries with more topographical heterogeneity, and lower values represent less.

#### Economics: Income {#gdppc}

##### Maddison Project Database {#maddison}

The Maddison Project Database was developed by University of Groningen to document and track global historical economic trends to gain a better understanding of the drivers behind periods of global economic growth and stagnation [@boltMaddisonStyleEstimates2020]. The most recent update includes histroical data for more than 160 countries. Using data collected from a variety of sources, the Maddison Project Database presents estimates of income, represented as Gross Domestic Product per capita, and the subsequent total population used to calculate income on a per person basis. Yearly estimates are provided on a per country basis, although due to data availability, estimates for some years (mainly prior to 1960) are not complete for all countries [@boltRebasingMaddisonNew2018]. In order to standardize methods of estimations across time and space, the most current version of the Maddison database relies on the extrapolation method to to determine yearly estimates. The total and per capita GDP were selected from benchmark year of 1990 and then estimates forwards and backwards are made based on growth rates from country national accounts (or other growth estimates). These estimates are then tested against independent benchmarks where they exist [@boltMaddisonStyleEstimates2020].

##### Description

#### External Influences: Democracy {#democracy}

##### Bjørnskov-Rode Regime Data {#BRdemo}

The Bjørnskov-Rode Regime Data developed by @bjornskovRegimeTypesRegime2018 presents a data set of political governance regimes and regime changes for 192 countries and 16 self governing territories between 1950 and 2016, including data regarding periods of colonial control, which other well known datasets such as @centerforsystemicpeacePolityProjectPolity2020 used in @neumannExploringGlobalIrrigation2011 do not include. The Bjørnskov-Rode Regime Dataset classifies governmental regimes into democratic and non democratic categories, each with three classifications, giving rise to six different political regimes.

+--------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Democracies                          | Non-Democracies                                 |
+======================================+=================================================+
| Parliamentary Democracies            | Civilian Autocracies (Leader w/o military rank) |
+--------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Mixed Democracies (w/weak president) | Military Dictatorships (Leader w/military rank) |
+--------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Presidential Democracies             | Royal Dictatorships                             |
+--------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+

In addition, a classification for "Colony" (i.e. most often "Former Colony") was created to better understand understand the relationship between external governance and irrigation fraction.

### LPJmL Data

The Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land (LPJmL) is a Dynamic Global Vegetation Model which simulates the global terrestrial carbon cycle and the corresponding response of vegetation patterns, both natural and managed, under a given set of climactic conditions [@schaphoffLPJmL4DynamicGlobal2018]. Spatially and temporally explicit data regarding climate, landuse patterns, and anthropogenic activities among others is fed into the model and used to simulate, via the LPJmL's established biophysiological interconnections, a multitude of processes and outcomes that relate to global vegetation patterns and carbon cycles[@pikLPJmLLundPotsdamJenaManaged]. Four predictor variables were used as input for or were extracted from the LPJmL model. They are detailed in the section below.

#### Compatibility: Distance to the Next Irrigated Cell {#dist}

##### LPJmL Derived Output

##### Description

#### Social Influences: Population Density

##### The History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE)

The History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE) was first developed by @kleingoldewijkHundredYear18901997 to better understand and map historical land use patterns anthropogenic activities. Several updates to this dataset have taken place since the publication of the original dataset and currently HYDE Version 3.2 currently includes population estimates and land use patterns for the entirety of the Holocene, which spans the last 12,000 years [@kleingoldewijkAnthropogenicLandUse2017].

For the study period (1960-2005) of this masters thesis, estimates of total population were collected from the United Nations World Populations Prospects [@unitednationspopulationdivisionWorldPopulationProspects2008]. Then this data is harmonized with world wide spatial population patterns from Land Scan [@oakridgenationallaboratoryLandScanLandscanGlobal2014] which shows global population density at a 1km resolution and was used to allocate population totals to each available administrative unit [@kleingoldewijkAnthropogenicLandUse2017]. Population data was then harmonized resulting in a final data product that yields population density, and other important land use data, on a 0.5° x 0.5° latitude longitude global grid.

The HYDE population density estimates were then used as an input to LPJmL

##### Description {#popdensdesc}

        axis.text.y=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y=element_blank()
  )

```

#### Water: Precipitation {#precip}

To encapsulate the relationship between the presence/absence of irrigation or the amount of irrigation in a cell and water, precipitation was chosen to represent this link. Several other variables existed that would have also represented the connection between a water source and irrigation expansion, however to reduce multicollinearity, only one variable could be used to encapsulate all the effects of water. Through an iterative modeling process of checking the strength and stability of different predictor effects, precipitation was ultimately chosen. In addition, using precipitation as a predictor conveniently fits best within the conceptual framework better than others with the notion that farmers will begin to irrigate when there precipitation cannot meet crop demand.

##### Climate Research Unit Time Series Dataset {#CRU}

Data for precipitation was collected from the Climate Research Unit of the University of East Anglia. This dataset is open-source and includes monthly precipitation data for a 0.5° x 0.5° latitude longitude global grid cell resolution over a time period of 1901 to 2018. To collect this data, individual station observations were anomolized by using the each station's monthly mean from the years 1961 to 1990 to standardize observations as a percentage of the mean monthly value (value of -100 means 0 precipitation, value of 0 is equal to monthly mean for a given station). These anomolies were then converted to a 0.5° x 0.5° latitude longitude grid using angular distance weighting ultimately giving rise to a single monthly value for each grid cell [@universityofeastangliaclimaticresearchunitVersionCRUTS2021].

#### Outcome Variable: Irrigation Fraction {#irrfrac}

##### Global Historical Irrigation Data Set {#HID}

Data for global historical irrigation patterns was collected from the Global Historical Irrigation Data Set (HID) [@siebertGlobalDataSet2015] which describes hectares of area equipped for irrigation (AEI) per grid cell at a 5 arcmin resolution [^2] over a period of 105 years, from 1900 to 2005. By documenting global and historical irrigation patterns, @siebertGlobalDataSet2015 hoped to create a better understanding of the evolution of said patterns. It is worth noting that the dataset provided in @siebertGlobalDataSet2015 documents area equipped for irrigation, meaning area that is equipped with infrastructure to irrigate crops but not *necessarily* irrigated. In addition, rainwater harvesting [^3] is also not included in the summation of area equipped for irrigation. [CITATION]

[^2]: At the equator, this is roughly a 9.2km by 9.2km grid cell resolution.

[^3]: The act of harvesting rainwater during rain and then later applying it to crops.

To amass this data @siebertGlobalDataSet2015 used a variety of sources to collect national and subnational statistics including FAOSTAT [@faoFAOSTAT2021], EuroStat [@europeancomissionEurostatDatabase2021], and Aquastat [@faoAQUASTAT2021] along with other less collected sources like census data and statistical yearbooks. Data was recorded for 10 year timesteps until 1980 and five year timesteps until the termination of the study period in 2005. Data for the period prior to 1950 and for the year 2005 has higher levels of uncertainty in the measurements when compared to the data between 1950 and 2005, as irrigation data from international organizations (e.g. FAO) were unavailable prior and post. After collection the data was harmonized and downscaled to a 5 arcmin resolution. Special care was taken to ensure that high resolution data (at a 5 arcmin resolution) could be accurately summed to the subnational level, ensuring accuracy at different resolutions. In addition, the authors note that validation of this dataset was not possible due to the fact that all available data was used as input to create the HID [@siebertGlobalDataSet2015].

The HID, in combination with other datasets such the History Database of the Global Environment ( @kleingoldewijkHundredYear18901997, see Section \@ref(HYDE)) and Climate Research Unit Time Series Data ( @universityofeastangliaclimaticresearchunitVersionCRUTS2021, see Section @ref(CRU)) were used was then fed into the LPJmL model. For the purposes of this masters thesis, a global irrigation pattern represented by percentage of irrigated area per cell at a 0.5° x 0.5° latitude longitude global grid cell resolution with yearly observations for a period of 1960 to 2005 was extracted from the LPJmL model .

##### Description {#irrfracdesc}

Levels of irrigation vary widely both geographically and temporally. In Figure \@ref(fig:irrfrac2005) the global irrigation pattern for the last year of they study period (2005) is depicted.

There are several "hotspots" of irrigation that occur, predominantly in the interior of the United States, north of India, Bangladesh, and Eastern China in which more than 30% of a cell is irrigated area. Otherwise, generally irrigation, where it exists, a small minority of cell area. No irrigation occurs in some places including towards arctic circle and in the Sahara, among other places.

When looking at the histogram of the data distribution of the target variable, irrigation fraction, it is clear to see that the data includes many zeros.

```{r irrfrachist, fig.cap="Histogram of the outcome variable, Irrigation Fraction (IF).", fig.scap="Histogram of the outcome variable, Irrigation Fraction (IF) for the entirety of the study region and period (1960 to 2005)."}

```

## Hypothesis {#hypothesis}

Based on information discussed above several hypothesis can be formed to investigate the expected effects of different predictors. As discussed previously there are two outcome variables in this masters thesis: the presence/absence of irrigation and the amount of irrigation. Hypothesis are similar for both predictor variables. The rational is explained below in addition to the hypothesis.

<!--# explain rationale! -->

For the amount of irrigation present in a cell the stated hypothesis for this thesis are:

1.  A **decrease in precipitation** will result in an **increase in irrigation**.
2.  A **decrease in population density** will result in an **increase in irrigation**.
3.  An **increase in income (GDP per capita)** will result in an **increase in irrigation.**
4.  A **decrease in topographical heterogeniety (ruggedness)** will result in an increase in **irrigation.**
5.  An **increase in democratic values** will result in an **increase in irrigation.**

For the presence or absence of irrigation, the following hypothesis are proposed:

1.  A **decrease in distance to the next irrigated cell** will result in an **increase of irrigated cells.**
2.  An **increase in population density** will result in an **increase in irrigated cells.**
3.  A **decrease in precipitation** will result in an **increase in irrigated cells.**
4.  An **increase in income (GDP per capita)** will result in an **increase of irrigated cells.**
