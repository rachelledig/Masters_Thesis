```
The initial dataset, graciously provided by Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) from the Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land (LPJmL) model, included information about a variety of biophysical predictors on a 0.5° x 0.5° latitude longitude global grid cell resolution with yearly observations from a period of 1900 to 2005. In total, this constituted a data set of roughly seven million observations. Inital trials were conducted to work with the entirety of the data provided, however it soon became apparent that seven million observations was too difficult to work from a modeling perspective. In an effort to decrease computation time and effort, a logical reduction of the study area (and therefore data) was necessary.

Upon initial investigations it was revealed that the rate of irrigation expansion from 1900 to 1960 was not the same as the rate post 1960 (see Figure \@ref(fig:irrexprate)). In addition, global socioeconomic data was scarce for periods prior to 1960 [@worldbankGDPCapitaCurrent2021]. Therefore, the decision was made to only focus analyzing global irrigation patterns from 1960 onward. This resulted in a reduction of data from seven million observations to roughly three million. Further reduction was still needed.

Figure \@ref(fig:irrfrac2005), pictured later in Section \@ref(irrfrac), illustrates the pattern of irrigation at the last time step (2005) of the study period. It is notable that irrigation does not exist at all in some places such as the higher latitudes and the Sahara, a pattern that was confirmed in earlier years as well. These areas also contain no cropland, no managed grasslands, and no pastureland. Upon the logic that irrigation cannot expand into areas that contain no agricultural land (whether it be cropland, grassland, or pasture land), all cells which contained no agricultural land over the the course of the study period were removed. Ultimately, irrigation expansion patterns from 1960 to 2005 within the study area you see in Figure \@ref(fig:study-region-nocrop) were analyzed.

## Data {#data}

To appropriately choose data that encapsulates the concepts and relationships described in Section \@ref(drivers) the following datasets and variables were collected and selected. It should be noted that many of these datasets contain more than one variable that would conceptually represent the links between expanding irrigation and various drivers. The predictors presented below were selected in an iterative model building process for various reasons including data availability (both spatially and temporally), modeling constraints, and conceptual fidelity. For more information on all potential variables please see Appendix Section \@ref(predselect).

The primary variable of interest in this masters thesis, irrigation fraction, along with several other predictor variable were used as input for or were extracted from the Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land (LPJmL) model. Other datasets for various predictors were gathered from datasets external to those used in LPJmL. Detailed descriptions of the acquisition of all data sets are in the sections to follow.

### External Data

#### Topography: Ruggedness {#rugged}

<!--# Come back and fix this part!! -->

In order to explain the relationship between topography and irrigation expansion, an index of a country's topographical heterogeniety was chosen. Other similar irrigation expansion studies similarly use slope (calculated from Digital Elevation Models (DEMs)) as a predictor for explaining irrigation expansion but do so using a 5 arcmin gridded slope dataset [@neumannExploringGlobalIrrigation2011]. Unfortunately for this thesis, grid cells used for analysis are significantly larger[^1], and an aggregation of slope to a larger grid cell was unfeasible for this thesis. Instead, a well know index of country topographical heterogeneity was chosen to represent the "ruggedness" of a country.

[^1]: A 5 arcmin global grid results in a 9.2km by 9.2km grid at the equator. This thesis uses a 0.5° x 0.5° lattitude longitude grid which produces a grid cell of about 55km by 55km at the equator.

##### Terrain Ruggedness Index {#TRI}

The Terrain Ruggedness Index (TRI) was developed by @rileyTerrainRuggednessIndex1999 initially to be used to analyze the effects of topography on species habitats and behaviors. The authors developed a simple method to calculate the heterogeneity of a given area using DEMs. To do so, the sum change in elevation is calculated between a cell and the elevation of its eight nearest neighbors. These individual cell level TRIs can then be averaged for a given region, in this thesis's case, a country [@rileyTerrainRuggednessIndex1999]. Adapted from @rileyTerrainRuggednessIndex1999, a representation of different topography types and the respective TRI scores is displayed in \@ref(fig:tricalc). The exact dataset used for country level TRI is from @nunnRuggednessBlessingBad2012.

```{r tricalc, fig.scap= "Example calculations of Terrain Ruggedness Index (TRI) for differing geographies.", fig.cap= "TRI values a) peak geography, b) bowl geography, c) rolling hill geography. Values presented in the tables represent elevations. Notice that for both a) and b) the TRI is the same despite very different geography, but both values are much higher than c) which is a more homogenous landscape.", out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/TRI_calc.png")
```

##### Description {#ruggeddesc}

In Figure \@ref(fig:TRI) the Terrain Ruggedness Index for the study region can be see. Higher values indicate countries with more topographical heterogeneity, and lower values represent less.

```{r TRI, fig.scap="Terrain Ruggedness Index values for the study area.", fig.cap= "Terrain Ruggedness Index (TRI) values on a country level basis. "}

#### Economics: Income {#gdppc}

##### Maddison Project Database {#maddison}

The Maddison Project Database was developed by University of Groningen to document and track global historical economic trends to gain a better understanding of the drivers behind periods of global economic growth and stagnation [@boltMaddisonStyleEstimates2020]. The most recent update includes histroical data for more than 160 countries. Using data collected from a variety of sources, the Maddison Project Database presents estimates of income, represented as Gross Domestic Product per capita, and the subsequent total population used to calculate income on a per person basis. Yearly estimates are provided on a per country basis, although due to data availability, estimates for some years (mainly prior to 1960) are not complete for all countries [@boltRebasingMaddisonNew2018]. In order to standardize methods of estimations across time and space, the most current version of the Maddison database relies on the extrapolation method to to determine yearly estimates. The total and per capita GDP were selected from benchmark year of 1990 and then estimates forwards and backwards are made based on growth rates from country national accounts (or other growth estimates). These estimates are then tested against independent benchmarks where they exist [@boltMaddisonStyleEstimates2020].

##### Description

Income (GDP per capita) varies widely across the study area, as can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:income2005)

#### External Influences: Democracy {#democracy}

##### Bjørnskov-Rode Regime Data {#BRdemo}

The Bjørnskov-Rode Regime Data developed by @bjornskovRegimeTypesRegime2018 presents a data set of political governance regimes and regime changes for 192 countries and 16 self governing territories between 1950 and 2016, including data regarding periods of colonial control, which other well known datasets such as @centerforsystemicpeacePolityProjectPolity2020 used in @neumannExploringGlobalIrrigation2011 do not include. The Bjørnskov-Rode Regime Dataset classifies governmental regimes into democratic and non democratic categories, each with three classifications, giving rise to six different political regimes.

| Democracies                          | Non-Democracies                                 |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Parliamentary Democracies            | Civilian Autocracies (Leader w/o military rank) |
| Mixed Democracies (w/weak president) | Military Dictatorships (Leader w/military rank) |
| Presidential Democracies             | Royal Dictatorships                             |

In addition, a classification for "Colony" (i.e. most often "Former Colony") was created by the author of this master thesis to better understand understand the relationship between external governance regimes and irrigation fraction.

### LPJmL Data

The Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land (LPJmL) is a Dynamic Global Vegetation Model which simulates the global terrestrial carbon cycle and the corresponding response of vegetation patterns, both natural and managed, under a given set of climactic conditions [@schaphoffLPJmL4DynamicGlobal2018]. Spatially and temporally explicit data regarding climate, landuse patterns, and anthropogenic activities among others is fed into the model and used to simulate, via the LPJmL's established biophysiological interconnections, a multitude of processes and outcomes that relate to global vegetation patterns and carbon cycles[@pikLPJmLLundPotsdamJenaManaged]. Four predictor variables were used as input for or were extracted from the LPJmL model. They are detailed in the section below.

#### Social Influences: Population Density {#popdens}

##### The History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE)

The History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE) was first developed by @kleingoldewijkHundredYear18901997 to better understand and map historical land use patterns anthropogenic activities. Several updates to this dataset have taken place since the publication of the original dataset and currently HYDE Version 3.2 currently includes population estimates and land use patterns for the entirety of the Holocene, which spans the last 12,000 years [@kleingoldewijkAnthropogenicLandUse2017].

For the study period (1960-2005) of this masters thesis, estimates of total population were collected from the United Nations World Populations Prospects [@unitednationspopulationdivisionWorldPopulationProspects2008]. Then this data is harmonized with world wide spatial population patterns from Land Scan [@oakridgenationallaboratoryLandScanLandscanGlobal2014] which shows global population density at a 1km resolution and was used to allocate population totals to each available administrative unit [@kleingoldewijkAnthropogenicLandUse2017]. Population data was then harmonized resulting in a final data product that yields population density, and other important land use data, on a 0.5° x 0.5° latitude longitude global grid.

The HYDE population density estimates were then used as an input to LPJmL

#### Water: Precipitation {#precip}

To encapsulate the relationship between the presence/absence of irrigation or the amount of irrigation in a cell and water, precipitation was chosen to represent this link. Several other variables existed that would have also represented the connection between a water source and irrigation expansion, however to reduce multicollinearity, only one variable could be used to encapsulate all the effects of water. Through an iterative modeling process of checking the strength and stability of different predictor effects, precipitation was ultimately chosen. In addition, using precipitation as a predictor conveniently fits best within the conceptual framework better than others with the notion that farmers will begin to irrigate when there precipitation cannot meet crop demand.

##### Climate Research Unit Time Series Dataset {#CRU}

Data for precipitation was collected from the Climate Research Unit of the University of East Anglia. This dataset is open-source and includes monthly precipitation data for a 0.5° x 0.5° latitude longitude global grid cell resolution over a time period of 1901 to 2018. To collect this data, individual station observations were anomolized by using the each station's monthly mean from the years 1961 to 1990 to standardize observations as a percentage of the mean monthly value (value of -100 means 0 precipitation, value of 0 is equal to monthly mean for a given station). These anomolies were then converted to a 0.5° x 0.5° latitude longitude grid using angular distance weighting ultimately giving rise to a single monthly value for each grid cell [@universityofeastangliaclimaticresearchunitVersionCRUTS2021].

#### Outcome Variable: Irrigation Fraction {#irrfrac}

##### Global Historical Irrigation Data Set {#HID}

Data for global historical irrigation patterns was collected from the Global Historical Irrigation Data Set (HID) [@siebertGlobalDataSet2015] which describes hectares of area equipped for irrigation (AEI) per grid cell at a 5 arcmin resolution [^2] over a period of 105 years, from 1900 to 2005. By documenting global and historical irrigation patterns, @siebertGlobalDataSet2015 hoped to create a better understanding of the evolution of said patterns. It is worth noting that the dataset provided in @siebertGlobalDataSet2015 documents area equipped for irrigation, meaning area that is equipped with infrastructure to irrigate crops but not *necessarily* irrigated. In addition, rainwater harvesting [^3] is also not included in the summation of area equipped for irrigation. [CITATION]

[^2]: At the equator, this is roughly a 9.2km by 9.2km grid cell resolution.

[^3]: The act of harvesting rainwater during rain and then later applying it to crops.

To amass this data @siebertGlobalDataSet2015 used a variety of sources to collect national and subnational statistics including FAOSTAT [@faoFAOSTAT2021], EuroStat [@europeancomissionEurostatDatabase2021], and Aquastat [@faoAQUASTAT2021] along with other less collected sources like census data and statistical yearbooks. Data was recorded for 10 year timesteps until 1980 and five year timesteps until the termination of the study period in 2005. Data for the period prior to 1950 and for the year 2005 has higher levels of uncertainty in the measurements when compared to the data between 1950 and 2005, as irrigation data from international organizations (e.g. FAO) were unavailable prior and post. After collection the data was harmonized and downscaled to a 5 arcmin resolution. Special care was taken to ensure that high resolution data (at a 5 arcmin resolution) could be accurately summed to the subnational level, ensuring accuracy at different resolutions. In addition, the authors note that validation of this dataset was not possible due to the fact that all available data was used as input to create the HID [@siebertGlobalDataSet2015].

The HID, in combination with other datasets such the History Database of the Global Environment ( @kleingoldewijkHundredYear18901997, see Section \@ref(popdens)) and Climate Research Unit Time Series Data ( @universityofeastangliaclimaticresearchunitVersionCRUTS2021, see Section @ref(precip) were used was then fed into the LPJmL model. For the purposes of this masters thesis, a global irrigation pattern represented by percentage of irrigated area per cell at a 0.5° x 0.5° latitude longitude global grid cell resolution with yearly observations for a period of 1960 to 2005 was extracted from the LPJmL model .

##### Description {#irrfracdesc}

There are several "hotspots" of irrigation that occur, predominantly in the interior of the United States, north of India, Bangladesh, and Eastern China in which more than 30% of a cell is irrigated area. Otherwise, generally irrigation, where it exists, a small minority of cell area. No irrigation occurs in some places including towards arctic circle and in the Sahara, among other places.

When looking at the histogram of the data distribution of the target variable, irrigation fraction, it is clear to see that the data includes many zeros.

```{r irrfrachist, fig.cap="Histogram of the outcome variable, Irrigation Fraction (IF).", fig.scap="Histogram of the outcome variable, Irrigation Fraction (IF) for the entirety of the study region and period (1960 to 2005)."}

        axis.ticks.y=element_blank())
```

## Hypothesis {#hypothesis}

Based on information discussed above several hypothesis can be formed to investigate the expected effects of different predictors. As discussed previously there are two outcome variables in this masters thesis: the presence/absence of irrigation and the amount of irrigation. Hypothesis are similar for both predictor variables. The rational is explained below in addition to the hypothesis.

<!--# explain rationale! -->

For the amount of irrigation present in a cell the stated hypothesis for this thesis are:

1.  A **decrease in precipitation** will result in an **increase in irrigation**.
2.  A **decrease in population density** will result in an **increase in irrigation**.
3.  An **increase in income (GDP per capita)** will result in an **increase in irrigation.**
4.  A **decrease in topographical heterogeniety (ruggedness)** will result in an increase in **irrigation.**
5.  An **increase in democratic values** will result in an **increase in irrigation.**

For the presence or absence of irrigation, the following hypothesis are proposed:

1.  A **decrease in distance to the next irrigated cell** will result in an **increase of irrigated cells.**
2.  An **increase in population density** will result in an **increase in irrigated cells.**
3.  A **decrease in precipitation** will result in an **increase in irrigated cells.**
4.  An **increase in income (GDP per capita)** will result in an **increase of irrigated cells.**

## Data Processing and Modeling {#data-processing-and-modeling}

### Thinning {#thin}

| *"The first law of geography: Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things." - Walter Tobler [-@toblerComputerMovieSimulating1970]*

Due to the fact that the selected data set contains both spatial and temporal aspects, it is necessary to investigate the relationship between neighboring observations in both time and space to check for *autocorrelation*. Autocorrelation implies that observations that are close together (both temporally and spatially) are more likely to correlated [@hainingModellingSpatialSpatialTemporal2020, p. 6]. Less information about a given parameter of interest is present in a dataset that contains autocorrelation (for justification, see [@hainingModellingSpatialSpatialTemporal2020, p. 7]) therefore it is necessary to account for autocorrelation in the dataset.

#### For Spatially Autocorrelated Structures {#for-spatially-autocorrelated-structures}

There are different types of spatial autocorrelation: positive or negative, strong or weak. Figure \@ref(fig:spatialautocorexp), taken from the text *Modelling Spatial and Spatial-Temporal Data* [-@hainingModellingSpatialSpatialTemporal2020, p. 173] illustrates these different types of spatial autocorrelation. Positive autocorrelation exists when neighboring cells have similar values, or follow similar trends. Negative autocorrelation, although rarely seen, represents the opposite, neighboring cells show dissimilar values or opposite trends [@hainingModellingSpatialSpatialTemporal2020].

```{r spatialautocorexp, fig.scap="Representation of different types and levels of spatial autocorrelation.", fig.cap="Representation of different types and levels of spatial autocorrelation. a) strong negative autocorrelation, b) negative autocorrelation, c) random, d) positive autocorrelation, e) strongly positive autocorrelation", out.width = "66%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/spatialautocorexp.png")
```

An investigation of spatial autocorrelation can be carried out multiple ways. The easiest is a simple visual inspection to visualize if clusters of similar data appear. For this masters thesis, an investigation of the outcome variable, irrigation fraction per grid cell, can be done using `bubble()` from the `sp` package to visualize if there are any clusters of similar data. It should be noted that spatial autocorrelation is scale dependent, meaning that depending on the frame of reference the amount of spatial autocorrelation seen can change [@hainingModellingSpatialSpatialTemporal2020, p. 172]. Spatial autocorrelation present at a country level, as seen in Figure \@ref(fig:spatautocor), becomes more or less apparent depending on whether the perspective is micro or macro.

```{r spatautocor, fig.scap="Visualizations of spatial autocorrelation in India and Brazil in 2005.", fig.cap="Representations of irrigation fraction clusters. The figure on the left represents the irrigaion fraction for India in the year 2005. The figure on the right represents the irrigaion fraction for Brazil in the year 2005. The use of a bubble chart shows clusters of highly irrigated areas, smaller dots represent less irrigation per cell, larger dots represent more irrigation per cell. ", out.width= "100%"}
IND <- aei_2005 %>% 
  subset(ISO == "IND")

BRZ <- aei_2005 %>% 
  subset(ISO == "BRA")


coordinates(IND) <- ~lon + lat
coordinates(BRZ) <- ~lon + lat


p1 <- 
  bubble(BRZ, "irrfrac", 
       maxsize = 1, 
       key.space = "right",
       key.entries = c(0.01, 0.05, 0.35, 0.5, 0.75), 
       main = "IF (Brazil, 2005)")

p2 <- 
  bubble(IND, "irrfrac", 
       maxsize = 1, 
       key.entries = c(0.01, 0.05, 0.35, 0.5, 0.75),
       key.space = "right",
       main = "IF (India, 2005)")

plot_grid(p2,p1, nrow = 1)
```

When visualizing irrigation fraction using `bubble()`, it is clear that in India there seems to be more cells which have similar amounts of irrigation grouped around them, i.e. cells with high irrigation fractions tend to be next to other cells with high irrigation fractions. In Brazil, these trends seem to be less apparent.

Other ways to measure spatial autocorrelation exist, such as Moran's I [@moranNotesContinuousStochastic1950]. Moran's I is a common statistic that calculates the similarities of neighboring cells values when compared to the global mean cell value of the area. If neighboring cells share the same sign in their deviation from the global mean cell value of the sampled area, a positive autocorrelation is shown, and Moran's I is positive. If neighboring cells illustrate different signs in their deviation from the mean, negative autocorrelation is present, and Moran's I is negative. Moran's I values that are closer to zero illustrate weaker autocorrelation and those farther away from zero (in a positive or negative direction) imply stronger autocorrelation [@hainingModellingSpatialSpatialTemporal2020, p. 175]. Moran's I values for India and Brazil are presented in the Table \@ref(tab:).

```{r}

# proj4string(IND) <- CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84")
# w <- 1/as.matrix(dist(coordinates(IND)))
# 
# diag(w) <- 0
# moranind <- moran.test(IND$irrfrac,mat2listw(w))
# 
# proj4string(BRZ) <- CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84")
# w2 <- 1/as.matrix(dist(coordinates(BRZ)))
# 
# diag(w2) <- 0
# moranbraz <- moran.test(BRZ$irrfrac,mat2listw(w2)) 


```

```{r}
# irrfracind <- spline.correlog(x=coordinates(IND)[,1], y=coordinates(IND)[,2],
#                          z=IND$irrfrac, resamp=100, quiet=TRUE)
# plot(irrfracind)
# 
# irrfracbraz <- spline.correlog(x=coordinates(BRZ)[,1], y=coordinates(BRZ)[,2],
#                          z=BRZ$irrfrac, resamp=100, quiet=TRUE)
# 
# plot(irrfracbraz)
```

#### For Temporally Autocorrelated Structures

### Standardization {#standardization}

### Time Series Considerations {#time-series-considerations}

### Hierarchical Modeling {#hierarchical-modeling}

Bayesian hierarchical modeling has some unique features in comparison to other forms of statistical influence. in the context of this thesis, the two main advantages or Bayesian Inference are an improved propagation of uncertainty throughout the modeling process and an ability to include prior information into models, allowing the inclusion prior knowledge [@gelmanRegressionOtherStories2020].

#### DAGs

A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)

```{r mudag, fig.cap= "Directed Acyclic Graph for Beta"}
irrfrac_dag <- dagify(
  irrfrac ~ income + popdens + precip + ruggedness + dist + medinc,
  income ~ demo,
  popdens ~ demo,
  dist ~ demo,
  outcome = "irrfrac",
  exposure = c("income", "precip", "ruggedness", "dist", "popdens", "medinc"),
  latent = "demo",
  labels = c(irrfrac = "Irrigation Fraction", income = "Income",
             popdens = "Population Density", precip = "Precipitation",
             ruggedness = "Ruggedness",
             dist = "Distance to Next Irrigated Cell", 
             medinc = "Median Yield Increase", 
             demo = "Democracy",
             unobserved = "Confounders")
)

ggdag_status(irrfrac_dag, use_labels = "label", text = FALSE) +
  guides(fill = "none", color = "none") +  # Disable the legend
  theme_dag()
```

```{r zidag, fig.cap= "Directed Acyclic Graph for zero inflated paramater zi"}
zi_dag <- dagify(
  irrfrac ~ income + precip + ruggedness + dist,
  income ~ demo,
  dist ~ demo,
  exposure = c("income", "precip", "ruggedness", "dist"),
  latent = "demo",
  outcome = "irrfrac",
  labels = c(irrfrac = "Irrigation Fraction", income = "Income",
             popdens = "Population Density", precip = "Precipitation",
             ruggedness = "Ruggedness",
             dist = "Distance to Next Irrigated Cell", 
             medinc = "Median Yield Increase", 
             demo = "Democracy",
             unobserved = "Confounders")
)

ggdag_status(zi_dag, use_labels = "label", text = FALSE) +
  guides(fill = "none", color = "none") +  # Disable the legend
  theme_dag()
```

To test these hypothesis, a quick view of correlations was carried out.

### Model Comparison {#modcomparison}

Multiple ways to compare models exist, some rely more heavily on a conceptual and causal understanding of the problem, others rely on predictive accuracy. Model comparison can occur *within-sample* or *out-of-sample,* meaning that comparisons calculated using data used to train the model (*within-sample*) or using data that has been left our when fitting the model (*out-of-sample*).

More informal methods of model comparison exist such as prior and posterior predictive checks, comparison of bayes' factor or bayesian $R^2$ among others. [@gelmanUnderstandingPredictiveInformation2014]. However, as these checks are done using within-sample data, and some can be prone to overfitting under certain circumstances [@mcelreathStatisticalRethinkingBayesian2020, chap. 7]
