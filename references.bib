  abstract = {Along the slopes of the Ailao Mountains in Yunnan Province, Southwest China, ethnic groups such as the Hani and Yi have developed an impressive landscape of terraced paddy fields over the past several hundred years. Their intensive terraced rice cultivation stands in striking contrast to shifting cultivation, the predominant mode of agriculture in tropical mountain areas. This study aims to clarify how terraced rice cultivation has been developed and sustained over many years in the Ailao Mountains from the viewpoint of agricultural technology. In terraced rice cultivation, considerable effort is paid to the preservation of paddy fields. In the dry season, most of the terraced paddy fields are kept inundated even when no crop is grown. This dry season irrigation helps to prevent the collapse of the terrace, in close relationship with various farming works. The long-distance channel irrigation systems maintained by local groups have secured a dry season water supply. In the wet season, on the other hand, protection of paddy fields from excess water is the major concern. Many kinds of drainage facilities can be observed both in the irrigation channel and in the terraced paddy field. Irrigation in terraced rice cultivation is designed not only for supplying water to rice plants but has various other purposes as well. In addition to the protection of terraced paddy fields, the unique practice of year-round irrigation plays many important roles, including storing water, maintaining favorable soil conditions for rice growth and providing a habitat for various edible aquatic animals. In conclusion, the terraced rice cultivation in the Ailao Mountains has been sustained by various types of technology, related in particular to irrigation and drainage, which have special bearing in the terraced paddy field.},

  abstract = {Many agricultural production areas worldwide are characterized by high variability of water supply conditions, or simply lack of water, creating a dependence on irrigation since Neolithic times. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the evolution of irrigation of agricultural lands worldwide, based on bibliographical research focusing on ancient water management techniques and ingenious irrigation practices and their associated land management practices. In ancient Egypt, regular flooding by the Nile River meant that early agriculture probably consisted of planting seeds in soils that had been recently covered and fertilized with floodwater and silt deposits. On the other hand, in arid and semi-arid regions farmers made use of perennial springs and seasonal runoff under circumstances altogether different from the river civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, and early dynasties in China. We review irrigation practices in all major irrigation regions through the centuries. Emphasis is given to the Bronze Age civilizations (Minoans, Egyptians, and Indus valley), pre-Columbian, civilizations from the historic times (e.g., Chinese, Hellenic, and Roman), late-Columbians (e.g., Aztecs and Incas) and Byzantines, as well as to Ottomans and Arabs. The implications and impacts of irrigation techniques on modern management of water resources, as well as on irrigated agriculture, are also considered and discussed. Finally, some current major agricultural water management challenges are outlined, concluding that ancient practices could be adapted to cope with present challenges in irrigated agriculture for increasing productivity and sustainability.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The availability of highly accessible and reliable monthly gridded data sets of global land-surface precipitation is a need that was already identified in the mid-1980s when there was a complete lack of globally homogeneous gauge-based precipitation analyses. Since 1989, the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) has built up its unique capacity to assemble, quality assure, and analyse rain gauge data gathered from all over the world. The resulting database has exceeded 200 yr in temporal coverage and has acquired data from more than 85 000 stations worldwide. Based on this database, this paper provides the reference publication for the four globally gridded monthly precipitation products of the GPCC, covering a 111-yr analysis period from 1901\&ndash;present. As required for a reference publication, the content of the product portfolio, as well as the underlying methodologies to process and interpolate are detailed. Moreover, we provide information on the systematic and statistical errors associated with the data products. Finally, sample applications provide potential users of GPCC data products with suitable advice on capabilities and constraints of the gridded data sets. In doing so, the capabilities to access El Ni\~no\&ndash;Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) sensitive precipitation regions and to perform trend analyses across the past 110 yr are demonstrated. The four gridded products, i.e. the Climatology (CLIM) V2011, the Full Data Reanalysis (FD) V6, the Monitoring Product (MP) V4, and the First Guess Product (FG), are publicly available on easily accessible latitude/longitude grids encoded in zipped clear text ASCII files for subsequent visualization and download through the GPCC download gate hosted on {$<$}a href="ftp://ftp.dwd.de/pub/data/gpcc/html/download\_gate.html"target="\_blank"{$>$}ftp://ftp.dwd.de/pub/data/gpcc/html/download\_gate.html{$<$}/a{$>$} by the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD), Offenbach, Germany.

This model is an extension of that originally proposed for disease mapping. It is illustrated by the analysis of the cumulative prevalence of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus as observed at the military examination of 18-year-old conscripts born in Sardinia during the period 1936\textendash 1971. Data concerning the genetic differentiation of the Sardinian population are used to interpret the results.},

  abstract = {The Equations Underlying Cities Cities are complex systems of which functioning depends upon many social, economic, and environmental factors. Bettencourt (p. 1438; see the cover; see the Perspective by Batty) developed a theory to explain the quantitative relationships observed between various aspects of cities and population size or land area. Despite the increasing importance of cities in human societies, our ability to understand them scientifically and manage them in practice has remained limited. The greatest difficulties to any scientific approach to cities have resulted from their many interdependent facets, as social, economic, infrastructural, and spatial complex systems that exist in similar but changing forms over a huge range of scales. Here, I show how all cities may evolve according to a small set of basic principles that operate locally. A theoretical framework was developed to predict the average social, spatial, and infrastructural properties of cities as a set of scaling relations that apply to all urban systems. Confirmation of these predictions was observed for thousands of cities worldwide, from many urban systems at different levels of development. Measures of urban efficiency, capturing the balance between socioeconomic outputs and infrastructural costs, were shown to be independent of city size and might be a useful means to evaluate urban planning strategies. Cities of all sizes can be modeled as interdependent networks of interactions and infrastructure. [Also see Perspective by Batty] Cities of all sizes can be modeled as interdependent networks of interactions and infrastructure. [Also see Perspective by Batty]},

It is suggested that this number may be an underestimation, and scarcity of clean water by 2050 may be worse as the effects of the three drivers of water scarcity, as well as of unequal growth, accessibility and needs, are underrated. While the report promotes the spontaneous adoption of nature-based-solutions within an unconstrained population and economic expansion, there is an urgent need to regulate demography and economy, while enforcing clear rules to limit pollution, preserve aquifers and save water, equally applying everywhere. The aim of this paper is to highlight the inter-linkage in between population and economic growth and water demand, resources and pollution, that ultimately drive water scarcity, and the relevance of these aspects in local, rather than global, perspective, with a view to stimulating debate.},

This paper investigates the multifarious journalistic, political, cultural and economic norms that dynamically influence media coverage of climate science. It explores the case-study of climate change to also work through factors shaping the translation of uncertainty in climate science. This project demonstrates that mass-media coverage of climate change is not simply a random amalgam of articles and segments; rather, it is a social relationship between scientists, policy actors and the public that is mediated by such news packages. Moreover, this research shows how mass media play a significant role in shaping the construction and maintenance of discourse on climate change at the interface of science and policy.},

  abstract = {Large compilations of heterogeneous environmental observations are increasingly available as public databases, allowing researchers to test hypotheses across datasets. Statistical complexities arise when analyzing compiled data due to unbalanced spatial sampling, variable environmental context, mixed measurement techniques, and other reasons. Hierarchical Bayesian modeling is increasingly used in environmental science to describe these complexities, however few studies explicitly compare the utility of hierarchical Bayesian models to simpler and more commonly applied methods. Here we demonstrate the utility of the hierarchical Bayesian approach with application to a large compiled environmental dataset consisting of 5 741 marine vertical organic carbon flux observations from 407 sampling locations spanning eight biomes across the global ocean. We fit a global scale Bayesian hierarchical model that describes the vertical profile of organic carbon flux with depth. Profile parameters within a particular biome are assumed to share a common deviation from the global mean profile. Individual station level parameters are then modeled as deviations from the common biome-level profile. The hierarchical approach is shown to have several benefits over simpler and more common data aggregation methods. First, the hierarchical approach avoids statistical complexities introduced due to unbalanced sampling and allows for flexible incorporation of spatial heterogeneities in model parameters. Second, the hierarchical approach uses the whole dataset simultaneously to fit the model parameters which shares information across datasets and reduces the uncertainty},

Utilizing Stimson's method of constructing aggregate opinion measures, data from 74 separate surveys over a 9-year period are used to construct quarterly measures of public concern over global climate change. We examine five factors that should account for changes in levels of concern: 1) extreme weather events, 2) public access to accurate scientific information, 3) media coverage, 4) elite cues, and 5) movement/countermovement advocacy. A time-series analysis indicates that elite cues and structural economic factors have the largest effect on the level of public concern about climate change. While media coverage exerts an important influence, this coverage is itself largely a function of elite cues and economic factors. Weather extremes have no effect on aggregate public opinion. Promulgation of scientific information to the public on climate change has a minimal effect. The implication would seem to be that information-based science advocacy has had only a minor effect on public concern, while political mobilization by elites and advocacy groups is critical in influencing climate change concern.},

It is hypothesized that most of such cases are related to crisis situations and to the definition of scientific boundaries. Therefore, at least two modalities of public communication of science should be distinguished: one is the routine, generally unproblematic itinerary of a scientific idea through the different levels of communication as presented by the continuity models; and the other is the dramatic (re)assessment of boundaries and professional competences in the public arena that is required by marginal situations. Continuity models need to be supplemented by a multilevel, multivariate model which enables us to explain this second modality and to understand in more detail the role that the level of public communication plays when such a modality is activated.},

Hierarchical models are a flexible statistical tool that allows for decomposing spatiotemporal processes in simpler components connected by conditional probabilistic relationships. This article reviews two hierarchical models that have been applied to tree-ring proxy records of climate to model their space\textendash time structure: STEM (Spatio-Temporal Expectation Maximization) and BARCAST (Bayesian Algorithm for Reconstructing Climate Anomalies in Space and Time). Both models account for spatial and temporal autocorrelation by including latent spatiotemporal processes, and they both take into consideration measurement and model errors, while they differ in their inferential approach. STEM adopts the frequentist perspective, and its parameters are estimated through the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, with uncertainty assessed through bootstrap resampling. BARCAST is developed in the Bayesian framework, and relies on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for sampling values from posterior probability distributions of interest. STEM also explicitly includes covariates in the process model definition. As hierarchical modeling keeps contributing to the analysis of complex ecological and environmental processes, proxy reconstructions are likely to improve, thereby providing better constraints on future climate change scenarios and their impacts over cold regions.},

We tested the framework on a case study of evaluating potential expansion for irrigated pasture in the Limestone Coast of South Australia. The core of the framework is the fuzzy linguistic ordered weighted averaging (FLOWA) model which integrates and implements fuzzy quantifiers, Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) in the ArcGIS environment. Fifteen criteria were chosen, including groundwater, topography, landscape and soil attributes which significantly affect irrigated landuse. Criterion weights were determined at both objective and attribute levels using the AHP, and several scenarios were derived using the OWA operator for selected values of fuzzy quantifiers. The resultant evaluation map from the weighted linear combination (WLC) approach was then compared with regional present landuse map. Most currently irrigated areas are contained within the area predicted to be suitable for irrigated agriculture. Relatively large additional areas are also predicted to be suitable, suggesting potential expansion, or that factors including total regional water availability and enterprise-specific economics are at play. The framework provides a useful tool with flexibility and efficiency. It enhances the existing AHP and OWA methods in the spatial context, and incorporates the uncertainty mechanism for guiding the multi-criteria decision making. It is particularly valuable given its capability to generate and visualise a wide range of multi-criteria decision scenarios, which can facilitate a better understanding of the spatial patterns of alternative landuse suitability potentials for future regional-scale landuse planning and water resource management.},

The influencing factors were categorized into demographic, socioeconomic, topographical, institutional, and attitudinal factor groups by 207 rice-growers in the Chaiyaphum province in northeastern Thailand. The results revealed that the land holding size, farm income, and water use association (WUA) membership factors were highly positively associated with the WW adoption. Meanwhile, age, farm income, skills training, and WUA membership were negatively correlated with the WP adoption. Nevertheless, proximity to a water source and upstream farmland location were positively correlated with the WP adoption. The WR adoption was positively associated with age but negatively correlated with the land holding size, upstream farmland location, and group participation factors. The cost-benefit analysis indicated that theWWirrigation scheme generated the highest economic return with the benefit-to-cost ratio schemes. The findings suggest that the WW irrigation technology would be deployed in the water management of other agricultural areas in the region to overcome the unfavorable geography and alleviate the local farmers' disadvantageous economic conditions.},

In regions of the world affected by water scarcity economic activities can be constrained by water availability, leading to competition both among sectors and between human uses and environmental needs. While the commodification of water remains a contentious political issue, the valuation of this natural resource is sometime viewed as a strategy to avoid water waste. Likewise, water markets have been invoked as a mechanism to allocate water to economically most efficient uses. The value of water, however, remains difficult to estimate because water markets and market prices exist only in few regions of the world. Despite numerous attempts at estimating the value of water in the absence of markets (i.e., the ``shadow price''), a global spatially explicit assessment of the value of water in agriculture is still missing. Here we propose a data-parsimonious biophysical framework to determine the value generated by water in irrigated agriculture and highlight its global spatiotemporal patterns. We find that in much of the world the actual crop distribution does not maximize agricultural water value.},

As such they offer powerful and flexible approaches to understand ongoing psychological processes and interventions, and allow for measurements to be taken a variable number of times, and at irregular intervals. However, limited developments have taken place regarding the use of continuous time models in a fully hierarchical context, in which all model parameters are allowed to vary over individuals. This has meant that questions regarding individual differences in parameters have had to rely on single-subject time series approaches, which require far more measurement occasions per individual. We present a hierarchical Bayesian approach to estimating continuous time dynamic models, allowing for individual variation in all model parameters. We also describe an extension to the ctsem package for R, which interfaces to the Stan software and allows simple specification and fitting of such models. To demonstrate the approach, we use a subsample from the German socioeconomic panel and relate overall life satisfaction and satisfaction with health.},

  abstract = {In the newly cultivated oases of northwestern China, the soil properties of farmlands with different cultivation periods show a high degree of spatial heterogeneity on the field scale. However, the irrigation water allocation at the irrigation district scale was based mainly on cultivated area but soil conditions were not considered, which resulted in the shortage or super abound of the irrigation water in the farmlands with different soils. A deeper understanding of the effects of soils on crop IWP and irrigation water requirement is an essential prerequisite to accurately assessing regional irrigation water needs and water-saving potential. Therefore, measurements were taken of the yield, irrigation water productivity (IWP), and nitrogen (N) uptake of maize grown in sandy soils (S1, S2), loamy sand soil (S3), and sandy loam soils (S4, S5) and subjected to three irrigation treatments (full, medium, and low irrigation) in an arid oasis farming system in northwestern China. The results show that the highest yield was obtained under full irrigation in sandy loam. Medium and low irrigation reduced the maize yield by 12.5\textendash 21.8\% and 13.5\textendash 20.6\%, respectively, relative to full irrigation, with the greatest decrease in sandy loam. Maize IWP ranged from 1.06\textendash 1.20\,kg m-3 for sand to 2.27\textendash 2.58\,kg m-3 for sandy loam and was influenced by soil properties but not irrigation treatments. Soil properties also influenced crop N uptake, with sandy loam having a significantly higher such uptake than loamy sand or sand. Under a conventional flooding irrigation pattern, reduced irrigation does not appear to increase IWP in well-drained sandy soils. Crop irrigation water requirement and IWP were mainly influenced by soil texture and fertility. Soil management to improving water productivity should be addressed. In agricultural water management, reasonable irrigation water allocation based on soil conditions should be considered.},

The guidelines on water use assessment include the impact assessment: the assessment of the environmental performance related to water use of a livestock-related system by assessing potential environmental impacts of blue water consumption following the water scarcity footprint according to the framework provided by ISO 14046 (ISO, 2014); and the assessment of the system's productivity of green and blue water. The guidelines are thus intended to support the optimization of use of water resources and the identification of opportunities to decrease the potential impacts of water use in livestock production.  The Water TAG guidance is relevant for livestock production systems, including feed production from croplands and grasslands, and production and processing of livestock products (cradle-to-gate). It addresses all livestock production systems and livestock species considered in existing LEAP animal guidelines: poultry, pig, small ruminant and large ruminant supply chains.},

Sustained socioeconomic development in countries with irrigated agriculture could be limited by water availability and deterioration in water quality. Consequently, any effort made to improve water use in irrigation practices will have a marked effect on sustainable agriculture and on conservation of soil and water resources. Problems associated with irrigated agriculture have been attributed to poor water management due to lack of knowledge of soil\textendash plant\textendash atmosphere relations, inadequate form of water application, hydrochemical relations triggered by irrigation, and soil's microbiological surroundings. Optimal design and selection of irrigation systems permit high efficiencies and uniform distribution of the applied water. Advanced planning and management of water is needed to ensure a sustainable agricultural process with optimal crop production, considering physical, environmental, financial, and technological restrictions. In addition, drainage techniques have also been developed, allowing removal of excess water from the soil profile. However, there is still a need to optimize water resource use and management to maintain sustainable irrigated agriculture considering water demand, water quality, economic evaluation of water, and decision support systems.},

  abstract = {As planetary boundaries are rapidly being approached, humanity has little room for additional expansion and conventional intensification of agriculture, while a growing world population further spreads the food gap. Ample evidence exists that improved on-farm water management can close water-related yield gaps to a considerable degree, but its global significance remains unclear. In this modeling study we investigate systematically to what extent integrated crop water management might contribute to closing the global food gap, constrained by the assumption that pressure on water resources and land does not increase. Using a process-based bio-/agrosphere model, we simulate the yield-increasing potential of elevated irrigation water productivity (including irrigation expansion with thus saved water) and optimized use of in situ precipitation water (alleviated soil evaporation, enhanced infiltration, water harvesting for supplemental irrigation) under current and projected future climate (from 20 climate models, with and without beneficial CO2 effects). Results show that irrigation efficiency improvements can save substantial amounts of water in many river basins (globally 48\% of non-productive water consumption in an `ambitious' scenario), and if rerouted to irrigate neighboring rainfed systems, can boost kcal production significantly (26\% global increase). Low-tech solutions for small-scale farmers on water-limited croplands show the potential to increase rainfed yields to a similar extent. In combination, the ambitious yet achievable integrated water management strategies explored in this study could increase global production by 41\% and close the water-related yield gap by 62\%. Unabated climate change will have adverse effects on crop yields in many regions, but improvements in water management as analyzed here can buffer such effects to a significant degree.},

While some climate and management aspects are common to semi-arid regions, the detailed mechanisms and options to secure ecological sustainability and economic viability may vary considerably from case to case. This paper applies a whole of system-water balance to compare irrigation in three semi-arid regions suffering from similar sustainability issues: Rechna Doab (RD), Pakistan; the Liuyuankou irrigation system (LIS), China; and Murrumbidgee irrigation area (MIA), Australia. Soil salinity, lack of adequate water resources and groundwater management are major issues in these areas. The MIA and LIS irrigation systems also suffer from soil salinity and low water-use efficiency issues. These similarities occur in spite of very different climatic and underlying hydrogeological conditions. The key data used to compare these different regions are climate and soils, available water resources and their use, as well as components of the water balance. In addition, the history of water resource development in these areas is examined to understand how salinity problems emerge in semi-arid regions and the consequences for production. Based on the efficiency parameters and the definitions of sustainability, approaches are explored to solve common environmental problems while maintaining economic viability and environmental sustainability for irrigation systems.},

  abstract = {Since the publication of the first edition, many new Bayesian tools and methods have been developed for space-time data analysis, the predictive modeling of health outcomes, and other spatial biostatistical areas. Exploring these new developments, Bayesian Disease Mapping: Hierarchical Modeling in Spatial Epidemiology, Second Edition provides an up-to-date, cohesive account of the full range of Bayesian disease mapping methods and applications. A biostatistics professor and WHO advisor, the author illustrates the use of Bayesian hierarchical modeling in the geographical analysis of disease through a range of real-world datasets. New to the Second Edition  Three new chapters on regression and ecological analysis, putative hazard modeling, and disease map surveillance Expanded material on case event modeling and spatiotemporal analysis New and updated examples Two new appendices featuring examples of integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) and conditional autoregressive (CAR) models  In addition to these new topics, the book covers more conventional areas such as relative risk estimation, clustering, spatial survival analysis, and longitudinal analysis. After an introduction to Bayesian inference, computation, and model assessment, the text focuses on important themes, including disease map reconstruction, cluster detection, regression and ecological analysis, putative hazard modeling, analysis of multiple scales and multiple diseases, spatial survival and longitudinal studies, spatiotemporal methods, and map surveillance. It shows how Bayesian disease mapping can yield significant insights into georeferenced health data. WinBUGS and R are used throughout for data manipulation and simulation.},

  abstract = {Whereas the importance of traditional irrigation in southern Europe is well known, its role in the ecological history of rural landscapes elsewhere in Europe is often overlooked. This two-part review aims to advance understanding of the historical and present role of traditional irrigation farming schemes in Europe. It confirms that, prior to the industrial era, irrigation had been an essential part of farming for centuries. It was practised in very different, often contrasting, environmental regions across Europe. The historical spread of the schemes is presented in a map. Two 'golden ages' of traditional irrigation in Europe can be identified: the first in the High Middle Ages along with the introduction and widespread adoption of the three-field system, and the second in the late eighteenth up to the first half of the twentieth century with reorganization of this agricultural system. Due to the complex character of past irrigation functioning, scientific understanding of processes and long-term impacts is difficult, but ultimately all irrigation farming enterprises were driven by the purpose of increasing yields. Apparently the traditional schemes were the result of an evolution process over the course of centuries characterized by steady optimization and adaptation to historic and local conditions.

In some regions, the proper growth both in terms of cropping density and surface area of irrigated areas is so significant that it needs to be included in future scenarios. A method for estimating the future evolution of irrigation water requirements is proposed and tested in the Tensift watershed, Morocco. Monthly synthetic crop coefficients (\emph{K}\textsubscript{c}) of the different irrigated areas were obtained from a time series of remote sensing observations. An empirical model using the synthetic \emph{K}\textsubscript{c} and rainfall was developed and fitted to the actual data for each of the different irrigated areas within the study area. The model consists of a system of equations that takes into account the monthly trend of \emph{K}\textsubscript{c}, the impact of yearly rainfall, and the saturation of \emph{K}\textsubscript{c} due to the presence of tree crops. The impact of precipitation change is included in the \emph{K}\textsubscript{c} estimate and the water budget. The anthropogenic impact is included in the equations for \emph{K}\textsubscript{c}. The impact of temperature change is only included in the reference evapotranspiration, with no impact on the \emph{K}\textsubscript{c} cycle. The model appears to be reliable with an average \emph{r}\textsuperscript{2} of 0.69 for the observation period (2000\textendash 2016). However, different subsampling tests of the number of calibration years showed that the performance is degraded when the size of the training dataset is reduced. When subsampling the training dataset to one-third of the 16 available years, \emph{r}\textsuperscript{2} was reduced to 0.45. This score has been interpreted as the level of reliability that could be expected for two time periods after the full training years (thus near to 2050).{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}The model has been used to reinterpret a local water management plan and to incorporate two downscaled climate change scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The examination of irrigation water requirements until 2050 revealed that the difference between the two climate scenarios was very small (\emph{\&lt;} 2 \%), while the two agricultural scenarios were strongly contrasted both spatially and in terms of their impact on water resources. The approach is generic and can be refined by incorporating irrigation efficiencies.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Innovative irrigation practices can enhance water efficiency, gaining an economic advantage while also reducing environmental burdens. In some cases the necessary knowledge has been provided by extension services, helping farmers to adapt and implement viable solutions, thus gaining more benefits from irrigation technology. Often investment in technological improvements has incurred higher water prices, however, without gaining the full potential benefits through water efficiency. Farmers generally lack adequate means and incentives to know crops' water use, actual irrigation applications, crops' yield response to different water management practices, and thus current on-farm water-efficiency levels. Those general difficulties are illustrated by our two case studies investigating options, stimuli and difficulties to improve water-efficient practices. The two areas have strong stimuli for improvement but lack a knowledge-exchange system to help farmers and resource managers identify scope for improvements. Partly for this reason, farmers' responsibility for efficient water management has been displaced to hypothetical prospects, e.g. extra supplies from reuse of treated wastewater or a long-term low water pricing. In both cases a displaced responsibility complements the default assumption that farmers' irrigation practices already have adequate water-use efficiency. Under current circumstances, agricultural water management will maintain the unknown water-efficiency level and farmers will have weaker incentives to make efforts for more efficient practices. A continuous knowledge-exchange is necessary so that all relevant stakeholders can share greater responsibility across the entire water-supply chain. On this basis, more water-efficient management could combine wider environmental benefits with economic advantage for farmers.},

The process aimed to bridge the values from the pioneers of organic agriculture to the present time of globalization and to extended growth of the organic sector. As a result the principles of health, ecology, fairness and care are now worldwide considered as the basis from which organic agriculture grows and develops. IFOAM institutionalized these four principles in its own work, for example in the revision of the Organic Guarantee System. The four principles offer a perspective on how to deal with the challenges of globalization. A response to these challenges seems to be to extend and further detail the standards so that, for instance, externalities can be included. However, stricter standards may not do justice to the principle of fairness, as they potentially undermine fair access to markets. Ideal would be a situation in which a balance between the principles and standards can be realized.},

Empirically, the frequency of newspaper coverage shows cyclical attention to global warming. The content analysis further reveals that implied danger and consequences of global warming gain more prominence on the upswing of newspaper attention, whereas controversy among scientists receives greater attention in the maintenance phase. The economics of dealing with global warming also receive greater attention during the maintenance and downside of the attention cycle. The discussion offers a narrative explanation and suggests the outcome of the ?master story? of global climate change may discourage future attention to global warming.},

Studies have predicted that the average global temperature may increase by 1.4\textendash 5.8\textdegree C and there would be substantial reduction in fresh water resources and agricultural yield by the end of the 21st century. Approximately 75\% of the Himalayan glaciers are on retreat and will disappear by 2035. Moreover in Africa (Sub-Saharan Africa) by 2050 the rainfall could drop by 10\%, which would reduce drainage by 17\%. Majority of the fresh water resources has already been depleted and there is reduction in agricultural production globally with escalation in population and food demand. Some of the prominent climate change impacts are, growing deserts, and increase in the magnitude of floods and droughts. An extreme decline in crop yields in arid and semi arid areas globally has caused food shortages and a manifold increase in food inflation. Countries of Africa, Middle East, Arab and Asia have close economic ties with natural resource and climate-dependent sectors such as forestry, agriculture, water, and fisheries. This manuscript highlights groundwater recharge by utilization of wastewater using the Soil Aquifer Treatment (SAT) method in irrigation and the significance and methods of artificial recharge of groundwater. This paper also presents easily and economically feasible options to ensure water and food security under climate change and recommend formation of effective adaptation and mitigation polices and strategies to minimizing the impact of climate change on water resources and irrigation.},

This paper synthesizes what is known, presumed, and still unknown about how to effectively communicate this problem. An introductory historical overview of climate change communication is followed by a discussion of the challenges that communicators face in trying to convey the issue (invisibility of causes, distant impacts, lack of immediacy and direct experience of the impacts, lack of gratification for taking mitigative actions, disbelief in human's global influence, complexity and uncertainty, inadequate signals indicating the need for change, perceptual limits and self-interest). The core of the paper focuses on key aspects of the communication process (purpose and scope of the communication, audience, framing, messages, messengers, modes and channels of communication, and assessing the outcomes and effectiveness of a communication). These elements are placed in relationship to several contextual factors that affect the communication process.

For developing countries, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) expects these areas to be expanded by 40 million ha, by 2030. Knowledge about the constraints to irrigation and spatially explicit information about the potential for irrigation expansion, however, are lacking on a global scale. The objective of our study was to explain the global pattern of irrigated croplands and to identify cropping regions where irrigation is likely to be expanded. We accounted for biophysical determinants, such as humidity and slope, mainly at grid-cell level. Socio-economic and governance determinants, for example, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and control of corruption, were primarily considered on a country level, given the limitations in availability of sub-national data and the role of national level governance in irrigation decisions. To identify the variability of the determinants within these two spatial levels, we conducted a multilevel analysis. This is a method employing regression models that explicitly account for hierarchically structured data. Results show significant variability in terms of irrigation. While 56\% of the global variance in irrigation occurs between countries, 44\% occurs within countries. Our results suggest that it is necessary to consider biophysical, socio-economic and governance information for identifying cropland areas that are likely to be under irrigation. Under current conditions, conversion from rainfed to irrigated cropland is most likely in eastern China, northern Africa, and parts of the Mediterranean region.},

With a spatial resolution of 5 arc min (about 9.2 km at the equator), MIRCA2000 provides both irrigated and rainfed crop areas of 26 crop classes for each month of the year. The data set covers all major food crops as well as cotton. Other crops are grouped into categories (perennial, annual, and fodder grasses). It represents multicropping systems and maximizes consistency with census-based national and subnational statistics. According to MIRCA2000, 25\% of the global harvested areas are irrigated, with a cropping intensity (including fallow land) of 1.12, as compared to 0.84 for the sum of rainfed and irrigated harvested crops. For the dominant crops (rice (1.7 million km2 harvested area), wheat (2.1 million km2), and maize (1.5 million km2)), roughly 60\%, 30\%, and 20\% of the harvested areas are irrigated, respectively, and half of the citrus, sugar cane, and cotton areas. While wheat and maize are the crops with the largest rainfed harvested areas (1.5 million km2 and 1.2 million km2, respectively), rice is clearly the crop with the largest irrigated harvested area (1.0 million km2), followed by wheat (0.7 million km2) and maize (0.3 million km2).

  abstract = {Predictions of global irrigated areas are widely used to guide strategies that aim to secure environmental welfare and manage climate change. Here we show that these predictions, which range between 240 and 450 million hectares (Mha), underestimate the potential extension of irrigation by ignoring basic parametric and model uncertainties. We found that the probability distribution of global irrigated areas in 2050 spans almost half an order of magnitude ({$\sim$}300\textendash 800 Mha, P2.5,P97.5), with the right tail pushing values to up to {$\sim$}1,800 Mha. This uncertainty is mostly irreducible as it is largely caused by either population-related parameters or the assumptions behind the model design. Model end-users and policy makers should acknowledge that irrigated areas are likely to grow much more than previously thought in order to avoid underestimating potential environmental costs.},

Here I use three different data sets with detailed information at the national level for 70\% of the countries of Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Europe between 1950 and 2017 to show that irrigated areas might grow disproportionally for a given increase in population, e.g., with {$\beta$} {$>$} 1. The results are robust across continents, time series, population cut-offs, and variations in the area accounted for irrigation by official institutions and independent scholars. This systematic pattern suggests the existence of an underlying law driving the growth rate of irrigated areas that transcends local particularities and can be well approximated by a power function of population, specially in the case of the Americas, Asia, and Europe. Nonlinearities derived from the open-ended growth rate of irrigated areas should be taken into consideration when designing irrigation policies in order to avoid unexpected environmental costs.},

  abstract = {When studying the empirical phenomenon of wildfires, we can distinguish between the occurrence at a specific location and time and the burnt area measured. This study proposes using structured additive regression models based on zero-one-inflated beta distribution for studying wildfire occurrence and burnt area simultaneously. Beta distribution affords a convenient way of studying the percentage of burnt area in cases where such percentages are bounded away from zero and one. Inflation with zeros and ones enables observations without wildfires or with 100\% burnt areas to be treated as special cases. Structured additive regression allows one to include a variety of covariates, while simultaneously exploring spatial and temporal correlations. Our inferences are based on an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation algorithm utilizing iteratively weighted least squares approximations as proposal densities. Application of the proposed methodology to a large wildfire database covering Galicia (Spain) provides essential information for improved wildfire management.}

We describe the world's semi-arid and dry sub-humid savannah and steppe regions as global hotspots, in terms of water related constraints to food production, high prevalence of malnourishment and poverty, and rapidly increasing food demands. We argue that major water investments in agriculture are required. In these regions yield gaps are large, not due to lack of water per se, but rather due to inefficient management of water, soils, and crops. An assessment of management options indicates that knowledge exists regarding technologies, management systems, and planning methods. A key strategy is to minimise risk for dry spell induced crop failures, which requires an emphasis on water harvesting systems for supplemental irrigation. Large-scale adoption of water harvesting systems will require a paradigm shift in Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM), in which rainfall is regarded as the entry point for the governance of freshwater, thus incorporating green water resources (sustaining rainfed agriculture and terrestrial ecosystems) and blue water resources (local runoff). The divide between rainfed and irrigated agriculture needs to be reconsidered in favor of a governance, investment, and management paradigm, which considers all water options in agricultural systems. A new focus is needed on the meso-catchment scale, as opposed to the current focus of IWRM on the basin level and the primary focus of agricultural improvements on the farmer's field. We argue that the catchment scale offers the best opportunities for water investments to build resilience in small-scale agricultural systems and to address trade-offs between water for food and other ecosystem functions and services.},

It is still unknown how irrigation water needs will change in a warmer planet and where freshwater will be locally available to expand irrigation without depleting freshwater resources. Here, we identify the rain-fed cropping systems that hold the greatest potential for investment in irrigation expansion because water will likely be available to suffice irrigation water demand. Using projections of renewable water availability and irrigation water demand under warming scenarios, we identify target regions where irrigation expansion may sustain crop production under climate change. Our results also show that global rain-fed croplands hold significant potential for sustainable irrigation expansion and that different irrigation strategies have different irrigation expansion potentials. Under a 3 \textdegree C warming, we find that a soft-path irrigation expansion with small monthly water storage and deficit irrigation has the potential to expand irrigated land by 70 million hectares and feed 300 million more people globally. We also find that a hard-path irrigation expansion with large annual water storage can sustainably expand irrigation up to 350 million hectares, while producing food for 1.4 billion more people globally. By identifying where irrigation can be expanded under a warmer climate, this work may serve as a starting point for investigating socioeconomic factors of irrigation expansion and may guide future research and resources toward those agricultural communities and water management institutions that will most need to adapt to climate change.},

  abstract = {The present study was designed to investigate the dynamics of rainfall patterns on the production and rate of decomposition of litter in the caatinga biome. To this end, a data series which had been recorded over 30 years (1981-2010) was used; the indicators taken into consideration being the irregular rainfall index, humidity index and consecutive wet and dry days. Litter was collected monthly over a period of two years (2009-2010) at 20 different locations, and totalled 480 samples. Samples were taken from all live individuals with a stem diameter of ô0.03 m and a height of ô1 m: 562 individuals in 25 recorded species were identified. The annual irregular rainfall index, calculated from the series, was 8.45, with a maximum precipitation of 1,763.9 mm (1985) and a minimum of 208.8 mm (1983). The difference in annual rainfall during 2009/2010 was 787.9 mm, 2010 showing greater temporal variability when compared to 2009. Using the humidity index, these years were classified as very wet and very dry respectively. The total annual rainfall influenced the annual production of litter, with 6034.22 kg ha-1 and 3311.96 kg ha-1 for 2009 and 2010 respectively. The temporal distribution of rainfall brings forward leaf senescence. In 2010 eight dry spells were recorded, and those that occurred in May and June particularly caused the leaves to fall earlier by almost 60 days, demonstrating that the distribution of rainfall over time speeds up the aging of leaves.},

These features render LPJmL4 suitable for assessing a broad range of feedbacks within and impacts upon the terrestrial biosphere as increasingly shaped by human activities such as climate change and land use change. Here we describe the core model structure, including recently developed modules now unified in LPJmL4. Thereby, we also review LPJmL model developments and evaluations in the field of permafrost, human and ecological water demand, and improved representation of crop types. We summarize and discuss LPJmL model applications dealing with the impacts of historical and future environmental change on the terrestrial biosphere at regional and global scale and provide a comprehensive overview of LPJmL publications since the first model description in 2007. To demonstrate the main features of the LPJmL4 model, we display reference simulation results for key processes such as the current global distribution of natural and managed ecosystems, their productivities, and associated water fluxes. A thorough evaluation of the model is provided in a companion paper. By making the model source code freely available at https://gitlab.pik-potsdam.de/lpjml/LPJmL we hope to stimulate the application and further development of LPJmL4 across scientific communities in support of major activities such as the IPCC and SDG process.},

Therefore, knowledge of the extent of irrigated land is important for hydrological and crop modelling, global change research, and assessments of resource use and management. Information on the historical evolution of irrigated lands is limited. The new global historical irrigation data set (HID) provides estimates of the temporal development of the area equipped for irrigation (AEI) between 1900 and 2005 at 5 arcmin resolution. We collected sub-national irrigation statistics from various sources and found that the global extent of AEI increased from 63 million ha (Mha) in 1900 to 111 Mha in 1950 and 306 Mha in 2005. We developed eight gridded versions of time series of AEI by combining sub-national irrigation statistics with different data sets on the historical extent of cropland and pasture. Different rules were applied to maximize consistency of the gridded products to sub-national irrigation statistics or to historical cropland and pasture data sets. The HID reflects very well the spatial patterns of irrigated land as shown on historical maps for the western United States (around year 1900) and on a global map (around year 1960). Mean aridity on irrigated land increased and mean natural river discharge on irrigated land decreased from 1900 to 1950 whereas aridity decreased and river discharge remained approximately constant from 1950 to 2005.

This report describes the update of the Digital Global Map of Irrigation Areas to version 5. For this update, the inventory of subnational irrigation statistics was updated with new information derived from national census surveys or irrigation sector studies. For the first time, the global map of irrigation areas also contains data layers on the percentage of area equipped for irrigation that is actually used for irrigation and on the source of irrigation water (groundwater, surface water, water from non-conventional sources). The number of subnational units in the global inventory increased to 36 090 for area equipped for irrigation, 10 316 for area actually irrigated and 14 483 for the statistics on the water source for irrigation. The reference years for the statistics differ between countries and variables but in most cases the data refer to period 2000 - 2008. Total area equipped for irrigation at the global scale in version 5 of this data set is 307.6 million ha of which 255.2 million ha (83 percent) were actually irrigated. 116.2 million ha (38 percent of the total area equipped for irrigation) were equipped for irrigation with groundwater, 191.2 million ha (62 percent) for irrigation with surface water and 0.3 million ha (0.1 percent) for irrigation with non-conventional water sources. In order to distribute the statistics on area equipped for irrigation per subnational unit, digital spatial data layers and printed maps were used. Irrigation maps were derived from project reports, irrigation subsector studies, and books related to irrigation and drainage. These maps were digitized and compared with satellite images of many regions. In areas without spatial information on irrigated areas, additional information was used to locate areas where irrigation is likely, such as land-cover and land-use maps that indicate agricultural areas or areas with crops that are usually grown under irrigation. In contrast, percentage of area actually irrigated and of area equipped for irrigation with groundwater, surface water or with water from non-conventional sources was kept constant in most cases for all grid cells belonging to the same subnational statistical unit because the information on the spatial distribution of these areas was very limited. Consequently, map quality differs a lot between the data layers. In the data layer on area equipped for irrigation, 93 percent of the total irrigated area was assigned to regions with excellent, very good or good map quality; the corresponding shares were 43 percent for area actually irrigated and 42 percent for the data layer on the water source of irrigation.}

Estimating the uncertainty of the resulting LOO-CV estimate is a complex task and it is known that the commonly used standard error estimate is often too small. We analyse the frequency properties of the LOO-CV estimator and study the uncertainty related to it. We provide new results of the properties of the uncertainty both theoretically and empirically and discuss the challenges of estimating it. We show that problematic cases include: comparing models with similar predictions, misspecified models, and small data. In these cases, there is a weak connection in the skewness of the sampling distribution and the distribution of the error of the LOO-CV estimator. We show that it is possible that the problematic skewness of the error distribution, which occurs when the models make similar predictions, does not fade away when the data size grows to infinity in certain situations.},

The data included: (a) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) 3-band and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) 10 km monthly time-series for 1997\textendash 1999, (b) Syst\`eme pour l'Observation de la Terre Vegetation (SPOT VGT) NDVI 1 km monthly time series for 1999, (c) East Anglia University Climate Research Unit (CRU) rainfall 50 km monthly time series for 1961\textendash 2000, (d) Global 30 Arc-Second Elevation Data Set (GTOPO30) 1 km digital elevation data of the World, (e) Japanese Earth Resources Satellite-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (JERS-1 SAR) data for the rain forests during two seasons in 1996 and (f) University of Maryland Global Tree Cover 1 km data for 1992\textendash 1993. A single mega-file data-cube (MFDC) of the World with 159 layers, akin to hyperspectral data, was composed by re-sampling different data types into a common 1 km resolution. The MFDC was segmented based on elevation, temperature and precipitation zones. Classification was performed on the segments. Quantitative spectral matching techniques (SMTs) used in hyperspectral data analysis were adopted to group class spectra derived from unsupervised classification and match them with ideal or target spectra. A rigorous class identification and labelling process involved the use of: (a) space\textendash time spiral curve (ST-SC) plots, (b) brightness\textendash greenness\textendash wetness (BGW) plots, (c) time series NDVI plots, (d) Google Earth very-high-resolution imagery (VHRI) `zoom-in views' in over 11 000 locations, (e) groundtruth data broadly sourced from the degree confluence project (3 864 sample locations) and from the GIAM project (1 790 sample locations), (f) high-resolution Landsat-ETM+ Geocover 150 m mosaic of the World and (g) secondary data (e.g. national and global land use and land cover data). Mixed classes were resolved based on decision tree algorithms and spatial modelling, and when that did not work, the problem class was used to mask and re-classify the MDFC, and the class identification and labelling protocol repeated. The sub-pixel area (SPA) calculations were performed by multiplying full-pixel areas (FPAs) with irrigated area fractions (IAFs) for every class. A 28 class GIAM was produced and the area statistics reported as: (a) annualized irrigated areas (AIAs), which consider intensity of irrigation (i.e. sum of irrigated areas from different seasons in a year plus continuous year-round irrigation or gross irrigated areas), and (b) total area available for irrigation (TAAI), which does not consider intensity of irrigation (i.e. irrigated areas at any given point of time plus the areas left fallow but `equipped for irrigation' at the same point of time or net irrigated areas). The AIA of the World at the end of the last millennium was 467 million hectares (Mha), which is sum of the non-overlapping areas of: (a) 252 Mha from season one, (b) 174 Mha from season two and (c) 41 Mha from continuous year-round crops. The TAAI at the end of the last millennium was 399 Mha. The distribution of irrigated areas is highly skewed amongst continents and countries. Asia accounts for 79\% (370 Mha) of all AIAs, followed by Europe (7\%) and North America (7\%). Three continents, South America (4\%), Africa (2\%) and Australia (1\%), have a very low proportion of the global irrigation. The GIAM had an accuracy of 79\textendash 91\%, with errors of omission not exceeding 21\%, and the errors of commission not exceeding 23\%. The GIAM statistics were also compared with: (a) the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and University of Frankfurt (UF) derived irrigated areas and (b) national census data for India. The relationships and causes of differences are discussed in detail. The GIAM products are made available through a web portal (http://www.iwmigiam.org).},

Yet how these climatic effects compare to other anthropogenic forcings is largely unknown. Here we provide observational and model evidence that expanding irrigation has dampened historical anthropogenic warming during hot days, with particularly strong effects over South Asia. We show that irrigation expansion can explain the negative correlation between global observed changes in daytime summer temperatures and present-day irrigation extent. While global warming increases the likelihood of hot extremes almost globally, irrigation can regionally cancel or even reverse the effects of all other forcings combined. Around one billion people (0.79\textendash 1.29) currently benefit from this dampened increase in hot extremes because irrigation massively expanded throughout the 20\$\$\{\}\^\{th\}\$\$ century. Our results therefore highlight that irrigation substantially reduced human exposure to warming of hot extremes but question whether this benefit will continue towards the future.},

Scenario analyses of future metal supply that take these factors into account would provide policy makers with information about possible supply shortages.

Here we analyze global groundwater depletion by considering these factors explicitly. Global gridded groundwater availability and extraction cost data are aggregated to produce nonrenewable resource supply curves for 235 major river basins and geopolitical regions. These resources are then exposed to dynamically generated demands for water in a fully coupled, multisectoral, global simulation. As groundwater head levels drop, imposing greater capital and operating costs to bring water to the surface, modeled water use sectors are able to deploy a range of supply- and demand-driven adaptive responses. Results demonstrate large sensitivity in global groundwater depletion rates to adjustments in resource exploitability. Extraction costs moderate demands for nonrenewable water substantially, resulting in the onset of a decline in global groundwater depletion rates within the twenty-first century. New groundwater depletion hot spots may emerge as crop producers abandon overexploited basins and expand croplands in regions with cheaper, more plentiful water resources.},

  abstract = {This study reviews 40 years of irrigation development in China including the transformation of the institutional and incentive structures in irrigation management. After rural reforms in the 1970s, irrigation investments slowed until the late 1990s. In North China, farmers became major investors in groundwater irrigation, leading to property rights' transfer of tube wells from collective to private ownership. Despite positive effects in cropping patterns, farmer income and development of groundwater markets, privatisation has accelerated groundwater table deterioration. Since the middle of 1990s, Water User Associations have replaced village collective management of surface irrigation. This approach was adopted by most provinces by early 2001 with mixed results; only institutions with water-saving incentives realised efficient irrigation. The Government is reforming water price policies to provide water-saving incentives to farmers while not hurting their income. While China has focused on water rights and markets, and despite regulations and pilot projects, full implementation of water rights has been slow. Research reveals greater policy scope for expanding irrigation technologies that generate real water saving to rural areas. Given pressure associated with water scarcity and concern for food security, further effective reforms in irrigation and policy incentives are expected. The Government has also initiated some pilot projects to resolve increasing water scarcity problems through adjusting agricultural production activities.},

Often, as is the case with atmo- spheric and oceanographic processes, these data contain many different scales of spatial and temporal variability. Such data are often non-stationary in space and time and may involve many observation/prediction locations. These factors can limit the effectiveness of traditional space- time statistical models and methods. In this article, we propose the use of hierarchical space-time models to achieve more flexible models and methods for the analysis of environmental data distributed in space and time. The first stage of the hierarchical model specifies a measurement- error process for the observational data in terms of some 'state' process. The second stage allows for site-specific time series models for this state variable. This stage includes large-scale (e.g. seasonal) variability plus a space-time dynamic process for the 'anomalies'. Much of our interest is with this anomaly proc ess. In the third stage, the parameters of these time series models, which are distributed in space, are themselves given a joint distribution with spatial dependence (Markov random fields). The Bayesian formulation is completed in the last two stages by speci- fying priors on parameters. We implement the model in a Markov chain Monte Carlo framework and apply it to an atmospheric data set of monthly maximum temperature.},

  abstract = {There is a long history in the ecological sciences concerning the development of mathematical models for describing the distribution of organisms over time and space. Although such models have sometimes been evaluated by comparison to observations, they have seldom been "fit" to data in a formal statistical sense. Thus, uncertainties regarding data, model, and parameters are not readily accounted for in such analyses. Alternatively, realistic statistical models for spatio-temporal processes in ecology often require that one estimate a very large number of parameters. This is typically not possible given the relatively limited amount of data collected over space and time. Critically, such a statistical model could be simplified (in terms of reducing the number of parameters) by accommodating the well known empirical and theoretical results concerning the process (e.g. partial differential equations (PDEs) or integro-difference equations (IDEs) for population spread). That is, the statistical model can make use of the well established mathematical models for the process. The Bayesian hierarchical paradigm for spatio-temporal models allows one to account for the aforementioned sources of uncertainty and yet still include such prior knowledge for the process, parameters and measurements. In this chapter, we provide an introduction to process-based hierarchical Bayesian spatio-temporal models for population spread, focusing primarily on PDE dynamics. We illustrate the concepts and demonstrate the methodology on the problem of predicting the Eurasian Collared-Dove invasion of North America.}

  abstract = {The existing quantitative literature on war takes the independent nation-state as the self-evident unit of analysis and largely excludes other political types from consideration. In contrast, the authors argue that the change in the institutional form of states is itself a major cause for war. The rise of empires and the global spread of the nation-state are the most important institutional transformations in the modern age. To test this hypothesis, the authors introduce a new data set that records the outbreak of war in fixed geographic territories from 1816 to 2001, independent of the political entity in control of a territory. Analysis of this data set demonstrates that wars are much more likely during and because of these two transformations. For the transformation to the modern nation-state, the authors confirm this hypothesis further with logit regressions that control for variables that have been robustly significant in previous research. The results provide support for the main mechanisms that explain this time dependency. Modern nation-states are ruled in the name of a nationally defined people, in contrast to empires, which govern to spread a faith across the world, to bring civilization to backward people, or to advance the world revolutionary cause. The institution of the nation-state thus introduces incentives for political elites to privilege members of the national majority over ethnic minorities, and for minority elites to mobilize against such political discrimination. The resulting power struggles over the ethno-national character of the state may escalate into civil wars. Interstate wars can result from attempts to protect co-nationals who are politically excluded in neighboring states. The reported research thus provides a corrective to mainstream approaches, which exclude ethnic and nationalist politics as factors that would help understanding the dynamics of war.},

  abstract = {Irrigated agriculture is important for satisfying the increasing world food demand, but it interrupts the natural hydrological cycle by applying additional water to crops. Accurate information regarding irrigation water use (IWU) is a prerequisite to exploit land surface modeling and to quantify the uncertainty of climate projections. In this study, the global IWU was estimated for 2000\textendash 2015 by combining satellite-based soil moisture (SM) observations from the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) and the model estimated SM from European ReAnalysis-5 (ERA5). Considering irrigation as an unmodeled hydrological process in ERA5 and the ability of ESA CCI SM to capture the irrigation patterns, the global IWU was estimated by solving the water balance equations for ESA CCI and ERA5 SM. Owing to the global absence of ground-truth data for IWU, the IWU estimates were compared with the reported irrigation water withdrawals (IWWs) provided by Food and Agriculture Organization. The results indicated that satellite-based SM observations have the potential to identify global irrigation. All three ESA CCI products (active, passive, and merged) discerned the global irrigated areas satisfactorily, and the estimated IWU captured the pattern of the country-level IWWs (R = 0.77, 0.72, and 0.81 for active, passive, and merged products, respectively). However, the estimated IWU substantially underestimated the reported IWWs (bias of -76.55, -76.01, and -73.93 km3 for active, passive, and merged products, respectively) due to the coarse spatial resolution (0.25\textdegree{} \texttimes{} 0.25\textdegree ) of the microwave remote sensing products and the inclusion of supplemental water in the IWWs, which was lost during distribution to crops. Trend analysis of the IWU indicated an increasing trend of the IWU in the first decade of the 21st century. However, in recent years the trend has reversed due to advances in agriculture technology and the adoption of water-efficient irrigation methods.}
